    #   image_raw - raw data from the camera driver, possibly Bayer encoded

    #   image_color      - color, distorted
    #   image_rect       - monochrome, rectified
    #   image_rect_color - color, rectified
    #
    # The image_pipeline contains packages (image_proc, stereo_image_proc)
    # for producing the four processed image topics from image_raw and
    # camera_info. The meaning of the camera parameters are described in
    # detail at http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_pipeline/CameraInfo.
    #
    # The image_geometry package provides a user-friendly interface to
    # common operations using this meta information. If you want to, e.g.,
    # project a 3d point into image coordinates, we strongly recommend
    # using image_geometry.

    # If the camera is uncalibrated, the matrices D, K, R, P should be left
    # zeroed out. In particular, clients may assume that K[0] == 0.0
    # indicates an uncalibrated camera.
